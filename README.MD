# XenoScan Slides

Slides, diagrams, and demo code for the XenoScan presentation at DEFCON 25.

Slides are written in markdown using remark. Fonts, images, scripts, and other resources are self-contained in the directory tree to allow for offline presentations.

Some paths in demo code are hard-coded and must be changed.
